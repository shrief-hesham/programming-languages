<td>It is easier to write a code in Python as the number of lines is less comparatively.</td>

<td>Python is an interpreted language and it runs through an interpreter during compilation.</td>
<td>C++ is a pre-compiled programming language and doesnâ€™t need any interpreter during compilation..</td>

<td>When it comes to Python vs C++, it is a dynamic language which reduces complexity when it comes to collaborating and optimizes programmer efficiency..</td>
<td>C++ has the advantage of being a statically typed language. The performance crown goes to C++ for creating a more compact and faster runtime code..</td>
